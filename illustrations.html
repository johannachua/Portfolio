              <h3><strong>abm</strong> Marketing</h3>
              <p>I was given the opportunity to create many illustrations for <strong>abm</strong>, a biotech company, when I was their marketing and design assistant during my co-op term in the summer of 2017. When they needed to advertise a product or service, I was responsible for making the layout and fun visual graphic to entise readers or social media users.</p>

            <p>For example, the cell spotlight templates were made to promote cells in the company's twitter account. I created the characters featured in the spotlight by just using Adobe Illustrator. It was great to see that the company liked the illustrations and have them post it on their social media accounts for their followers to see.</p>

              <h3>Motion Graphics</h3>
              <p>During my work term, I was also responsible for creating graphic animations to advertise <strong>abm</strong>'s services. I suggested to animate the graphics to help catch a reader's attention and accompany the description with a fun and interesting graphic. This process was fast paced as once they had an idea what they wanted to post, I would just directly go to Adobe Illustator and make character vectors and animate them using Adobe After Effects. Once my graphic is reviewed for adjustments and approved to be uploaded, it would then be posted on <strong>abm</strong>'s social media pages for their followers and customers to view publicly.</p>
