              <h3>About the Project</h3>
              <p>Lighthouse is a mobile application that was created from IAT 334, a course primarily focused on visual interfaces and user research. This project was completed in a team of 5 over the course of a month where we explored the idea of how we can provide possible solutions to youth aid. With this project, my team and I decided to create a user-content generated application where users can sign up to host a safe space within their homes to assist troubled lgbtqa+ youth. Lighthouse's purpose is to provide a safe environment to any youth who may seek immediate refuge.</p>
              <p>You can visit the <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~johannac/Lighthouse/src/" class="text-link">Lighthouse Website</a> to find out more about the system.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>Within the team, I was responsible for creating a site map for the seeker <a href="#framework" class="text-link">(See Journey Framework Image)</a>. It was mainly used to help the team visualize how to design for the user flow and it was used to highlight possible experiences, actions, thoughts, and as well as how the user would achieve their goal.</p>
            <p>Once the team refined the main user flow, I was then responsible for creating some mockups of the user interface. For example, I created the directions section of the app. For this section, I designed the interface to have the user easily follow simple directions to get to their destination and produced main icons of transportaion for the seeker to choose from to accomodate them in their travels <a href="#directions" class="text-link">(See Mockups of Directions Interface)</a>. I was also responsible for animating the filters process to exhibit how the filter process would work after logging in the app <a href="#filters" class="text-link">(See below)</a>. Animating the filtering process helped in observing what the user will experience and to test if the main interfaces is effective. Overall, this Lighthouse project has helped me learn to focus on designing for the user and practice not to design for myself.</p>
